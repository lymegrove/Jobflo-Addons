# Awesome Jobflo Addons

A curated, community-maintained registry of addons for [Jobflo](https://github.com/jsrothwell) — local-first job data ingestion and parsing. Each addon plugs into Jobflo through the `@jobflo/addon-sdk` contract, either as a **parser addon** that ingests and normalizes job data from a specific source, or as a **chart addon** that turns already-parsed job data into a visualization for the analytics section.

Browse the registry as a web page at the [GitHub Pages showcase](https://lymegrove.github.io/Jobflo-Addons/).

This repository is an npm workspaces monorepo containing:

- **`packages/sdk`** — [`@jobflo/addon-sdk`](packages/sdk), the TypeScript SDK addons are built against.
- **`addons/`** — the registry of community addons, including the [`starter-template`](addons/starter-template) reference implementation.
- **`docs/`** — the GitHub Pages showcase site, generated from each addon's `manifest.json` via `npm run build:registry`.

## Quickstart

Clone the repo and install dependencies for all workspaces:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jsrothwell/Jobflo-Addons.git
cd Jobflo-Addons
npm install
npm run build
```

Explore the SDK types and helpers:

```ts
import { defineAddon, defineChartAddon } from "@jobflo/addon-sdk";
```

Use [`addons/starter-template`](addons/starter-template) as the base for a new parser addon.

## Building a Parser Addon

1. **Scaffold** a new folder under `addons/<your-addon-name>`, copying the structure of `addons/starter-template`.
2. **Add the SDK** as a dependency in your addon's `package.json`:
   ```json
   "dependencies": {
     "@jobflo/addon-sdk": "*"
   }
   ```
3. **Implement the contract** using `defineAddon()` from `@jobflo/addon-sdk`, providing:
   - An `AddonManifest` (id, name, version, description, author, permissions, targetEvents).
   - A `parse` implementation that turns a `DataIngestPayload` into a `ParserResult`.
4. **Add a `manifest.json`** at the root of your addon folder (see `addons/starter-template/manifest.json`) — this powers the registry showcase site and needs `id`, `name`, `description`, `author`, `version`, and optional `category`/`tags`.
5. **Keep it local-first.** Addons should not require network access to function; declare any required `permissions` explicitly in the manifest.
6. **Type-check** your addon: `npm run build --workspace=addons/<your-addon-name>`.

## Building a Chart Addon

Chart addons turn already-parsed `ParsedJob[]` records into a visualization for the analytics section, rather than parsing raw ingested content. Use `defineChartAddon()` instead of `defineAddon()`:

1. **Scaffold** a new folder under `addons/<your-addon-name>`, following the same layout as a parser addon (`manifest.json`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `src/index.ts`).
2. **Add the SDK** as a dependency, same as a parser addon.
3. **Implement the contract** using `defineChartAddon()` from `@jobflo/addon-sdk`, providing:
   - An `AddonManifest` with `"analytics:render"` in `targetEvents`, so the host offers it in the analytics section.
   - A `render` implementation that turns a `ChartRequest` (`{ jobs: ParsedJob[], options?: ChartRenderOptions }`) into a `ChartResult`.
4. **Return self-contained output.** `ChartResult.content` must be a bare, self-contained `"svg"` or `"html"` string — no external network requests, no relative asset paths — since the host renders it directly with no further fetching. Inline any chart-library runtime output as static markup (e.g. via server-side/string rendering) rather than assuming a browser DOM is available at render time.
5. **Handle empty and malformed input gracefully.** Return a partial or placeholder `content` alongside one or more `ChartError`s rather than throwing, consistent with how parser addons handle bad input.
6. **Add a `manifest.json`** and **type-check**, same as a parser addon.

Different chart addons are free to use different rendering approaches/libraries internally (e.g. one computing its own SVG paths, another using a charting library's static/server-rendering mode) — the only requirement the host cares about is the final self-contained `ChartResult.content`.

## Submitting an Addon (Pull Request Guidelines)

1. Fork this repository and create a branch for your addon.
2. Add your addon under `addons/<your-addon-name>` following the steps above.
3. Ensure `npm run build` succeeds with zero errors across the whole workspace.
4. Add a row for your addon to the **Addon Index** table above.
5. Open a Pull Request describing:
   - What data source(s) your addon supports (parser addons) or what it visualizes (chart addons).
   - What permissions it requires and why.
   - Any setup or configuration steps for users.
6. A maintainer will review for SDK compliance, security (declared permissions match actual behavior), and code quality before merging.
